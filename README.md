# Coder Swag

Merchandise app from section 6 ('List and Recycler Views') of [Kotlin for Android: Beginner to Advanced Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/devslopes-android-kotlin/)

# To do:

## Implement

- Introduce concept of having different product descriptions for each product item on the product detail page
- Add a (UI only) 'ADD TO CART!' button as shown here: https://medium.com/devslopes-blog/exercise-show-me-the-product-eda7a469a3da

## Test

 After it works:

- Check in the DevSlopes task page - check that I have named and done everything in the same way
- Try to make the layout file for the ProductDetailActivity match up with the UX design shown in the DevSlopes task page.
- Test out different products to see if they get displayed correctly. Make sure that the back button works. Make sure that the whole flow of the app works.
- Testing: You should be able to click anywhere on the product (i.e. on the image, price or description) to open the product detail page.
- Testing: Make sure the new page looks good on both a tablet and phone
- Testing: Check what happens when we rotate the ProductDetailActivity screen - do we still see the correct data? Or do we need to store it in the activity so that rotations don't remove the data once the activity lifecycle changes?
- Go through changes and commit and push them
- Install the latest version of the app onto your phone so you can show the others
- If you have time: create a branch and change data to be relating to either recipes or random objects from the Boulder Pad
