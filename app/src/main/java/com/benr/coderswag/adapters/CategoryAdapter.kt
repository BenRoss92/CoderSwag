        // The View Holder pattern is a common android pattern. The reason we use the View Holder pattern is to avoid needing to call `findViewById` many times as it's computationally expensive and can affect the smoothness of scrolling. Our ViewHolder will store references to the View objects we need to change (i.e. the TextView and ImageView in our single row), so that we don't have to call `findViewById` every time a new row is being created.
        var holder: ViewHolder
        // The View of our single row that we want to display (i.e. return from `getView`).
        var categoryItemView: View

        // You don't need to get access to the categoryListView UI element here (i.e. inside of your custom adapter). You reference it later on in the activity (MainActivity) when setting the adapter of the categoryListView UI element to be our custom adapter. You need to do it in the MainActivity because that's where we're going to pass in the list of category instances.

        // Our adapter will just reference a single category list item in this method, not the whole category list - i.e. we only need to reference the category_list_item.xml Layout, as this represents one category item only.

        // Inflate the Layout for a single category list item so that you can programmatically change what the category name and category image should be for each category in the category list

        // Inflating the view (using LayoutInflater) is an expensive computation. We want to minimise the amount of times we have to inflate a view. To avoid inflating the view for every time we want a new row created, we can use `convertView`. `convertView` represents the previous row that was displayed (as a View object). `convertView` will be null if a row hasn't been displayed before (i.e. if this is the first row to be displayed). We only need to create the row manually (by inflating a view) when we haven't displayed a row before (i.e. when `convertView` is null). If we have created a row before, take the previous row displayed and reuse (recycle) it (i.e. assign our current row View to be the previous row View and then manipulate the text and image later).
        // If the user hasn't scrolled before: create a new View Holder, get the Text and Image Views from the inflated layout object and store them in the View Holder. Then the same TextView and ImageView can be reused for every new row (all we have to do is then change whatever data we want to display inside the TextView and ImageView).
        if (convertView == null) {
            // Create the View Holder where we'll store references to the Image and Text Views

Then find the View objects of these components inside of the inflated category_list_item layout object using their resource IDs.
            val categoryNameElementId = R.id.categoryName
            val categoryImageElementId = R.id.categoryImage

            // The `tag` property (inside of the View object) can store whatever you want (it can be any type of Object).
            // Every time the `getView` method is called, new `categoryItemView` and `holder` variables will be created, therefore they won't store the previous row View and the references to the TextView and ImageView. The way around this is that the value of `categoryItemView` (the row View) will be assigned to `convertView` automatically by Android. So the next time `getView` is called automatically, `convertView` will have the same value as the previous `categoryItemView` value. We can store the current ViewHolder instance inside of `categoryItemView` by using the `tag` property (this property can be assigned any type of object). That way, the next time `getView` is called, `convertView` will be automatically assigned the previous value of `categoryItemView`, including whatever was stored in the `tag` property (i.e. the previous `ViewHolder` instance).
            categoryItemView.tag = holder
        } else {
            // As the `tag` property value can be any type of Object, we need to explicitly tell Android that its value is an instance of `ViewHolder` (this value was set during the last call to `getView`.
            // The `holder` and `categoryItemView` variables will be empty each time `getView` is called, so we need to assign them values.
            holder = convertView.tag as ViewHolder
            // If `getView` has been called previously by Android, Android will automatically assign `convertView` as the previous value of `categoryItemView`. Here we assign this value back to `categoryItemView` so that we can distinguish between the current row View that we have control over (`categoryItemView`) and the previous row View that Android has control over (`convertView`).
            categoryItemView = convertView
        }
